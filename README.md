## Farm Stack
Farm stack is a end to end solution that helps farmers to grow crops sustainably and helps to achieve sustainability in the long run.

Powered by Esri - ArcGIS Platform.

## Inspiration
Farm lands are becoming unusable due to loss of top soil as same crops are grown again and again and due to lack of knowledge on sustainable farming for growth.

India has been facing this problem and the area of farmlands is reducing at an alarming rate.
Our solution will help the Indian farmers to get knowled about sustainable growth of crops for their benifit and the environment's benifit.
